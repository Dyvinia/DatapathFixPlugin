DatapathFix is an experimental Frosty plugin to fix an issue with modding games on platforms other than Origin (EA Desktop, Epic Games Store, Steam), where mods do not appear in the game. This plugin works with games that FrostyFix does not support.

## Instructions

### Troubleshooting
- If EA Desktop tells you that you do not own the game, restart it through the in-app restart button.
- If Steam/EpicGamesStore has the game stuck as "Running" completely kill and restart Steam/EpicGamesStore aswell as all EA related processes.
- If the game shows up as "DatapathFix" in Frosty, try to launch the game like normal and it should fix itself.
- Make sure to disable the LaunchPlatformPlugin that comes with Frosty.
