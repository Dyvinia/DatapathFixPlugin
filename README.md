DatapathFix is an experimental Frosty plugin to fix an issue with modding games on platforms other than Origin/EA Desktop (Epic Games Store & Steam), where mods do not appear in the game. This plugin works with games that FrostyFix does not support.

### Troubleshooting
- Disable In Game Overlay in EA Desktop
- If EA Desktop tells you that you do not own the game, restart it through the in-app restart button.
- If Steam/EpicGamesStore has the game stuck as "Running" completely kill and restart Steam/EpicGamesStore aswell as all EA related processes.
- If the game shows up as "DatapathFix" in Frosty, try to launch the game like normal and it should fix itself.
- Make sure to disable the LaunchPlatformPlugin that comes with Frosty.
